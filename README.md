# Softwareentwicklung-Projekt

you need the folloing packages to run this program:
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
dotnet add package System.Drawing.Common --version 5.0.2

Image files need to be named in the following way:

22_22-07-2021_50-93_13-34.jpg

Hour_Day-Month-Year_Latitude_Longitude

This data describes when and where the picture was taken.
latitude and longitude are to be named with two decimal places. The dot is to be replaced with an hyphen.

The Programm only works with dates from the last 5 day because that is the limitation of the used API
