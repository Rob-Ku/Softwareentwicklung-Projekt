# Softwareentwicklung-Projekt

You must run the following command to install the project's dependencies:
```
dotnet restore
```

Image files need to be in the "s_img" folder and need to be named in the following way:

22_22-07-2021_50-93_13-34.jpg

Hour_Day-Month-Year_Latitude_Longitude

This data describes when and where the picture was taken.
Latitude and Longitude are to be named with two decimal places. The dezimal-dot is to be replaced with an hyphen.

The Programm only works with dates from the last 5 day because that is the limitation of the used API

this is the output that the programm currently gives you after inputting an image: <br>
